## Features

* :squirrel: When the user uploads a file, it's checked
* :biohazard: Infected files will be deleted and a notification will be shown and/or sent via email 
* :mag_right: It runs a background job to scan all files

## What is planned

* :chart_with_upwards_trend: File size limit
* :wrench: Configuration Tuneups
* :telescope: Wider OS testing
* :thinking: Looking for ideas

## Requirements

* Nextcloud 12 or 13
* ClamAV as binaries or as server running ClamAV in daemon mode (recommended :heart:)

## Install

Documentation about installing ClamAV and this app can be found in [our documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/13/admin_manual/configuration_server/antivirus_configuration.html).

## Details

This app can be configured to work with the executable or the daemon mode (recommended :heart:) of ClamAV. If this is used in daemon mode it can conntect through network- or local file-socket. In daemon mode, it sends files to a remote/local server using `INSTREAM`-command.
